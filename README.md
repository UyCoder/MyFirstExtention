# My Chrome Extensions

This repository contains three Chrome extensions that I created for learning purposes. The extensions are:

1. Hacker News Extension: Shows the latest articles on the Hacker News website in a small smartphone view.
2. Calculator Extension: A copy of the HTML calculator file made into a Chrome extension.
3. Website View Extension: Opens a specific website in a small smartphone view.

## Installation

To install these extensions:

1. Download the extension files from GitHub.
2. In Chrome, go to the extensions page (chrome://extensions/) and enable "Developer mode". Then click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory for the extension you want to install.

## Usage

1. For the Hacker News Extension and Website View Extension, you should see the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar. Clicking on the icon will open a popup with the website displayed in a small smartphone view.
2. For the Calculator Extension, you can use the calculator directly from the extension popup.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

During the development process, I learned how to create and configure a `manifest.json` file, how to use an `iframe` element to display a website in a small smartphone view, and how to debug and test a Chrome extension. I also learned about the different types of Chrome extension options, such as browser actions and page actions.

## Future Plans

I plan to continue learning about Chrome extension development and potentially create more extensions that solve real-world problems. I also plan to improve the existing extensions by adding new features and fixing any bugs.
